# Kuruit Bedan Fash5

Kuruit Bedan Fash5 is a web app that follows the same game rules established by Cards Against Humanity but the cards are in Egyptian Arabic (Masri) and based on Egyptian Culture.

All Kuruit Bedan Fash5 cards are crowdsourced, meaning that all the cards are submitted and voted on by the community not the Herp Project Staff.

# Acknowledgments

This game is clearly inspired by Cards Against Humanity... but we do not have any Cards Against Humanity cards in the game.
All KBF cards are made by the KBF community.
