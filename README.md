# Kuruit Bedan Fash5

Kuruit Bedan Fash5 is a web app that follows the same game rules established by Cards Against Humanity but all Kuruit Bedan Fash5 cards are crowdsourced, meaning that all the cards are submitted and voted on by the community and every Country has its own exclusive cards based on their culture and language.

# Acknowledgments

This game is clearly inspired by Cards Against Humanity... but we do not have any Cards Against Humanity cards in the game.
