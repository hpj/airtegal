# Kuruit Bedan Fash5

Kuruit Bedan Fash5 is a fill-in-the-blank party game where all the cards are made by the community (crowdsourced), meaning that all the cards are submitted and voted on by the community, every country has its own cards based on their culture and language.

# Acknowledgments

This game is clearly inspired by Cards Against Humanity... but we do not have any Cards Against Humanity cards in the game.
